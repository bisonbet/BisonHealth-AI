### TypeScript
**Decision**: Comprehensive TypeScript implementation
**Rationale**:
- Type safety prevents runtime errors
- Better developer experience with autocompletion
- Easier maintenance and refactoring
- Clearer code documentation through types

### Prisma ORM
**Decision**: Use Prisma with PostgreSQL
**Rationale**:
- Strong typing for database operations
- Migration management capabilities
- Database agnostic schema definitions
- Built-in query optimization

## Architecture Patterns

### Modular Component Structure
**Decision**: Atomic design approach with clear separation of concerns
**Rationale**:
- Reusable components across the application
- Easier testing and maintenance
- Clear component hierarchy (atoms → molecules → organisms)
- Consistent styling and behavior

### Authentication Architecture
**Decision**: JWT-based authentication with NextAuth.js v5
**Rationale**:
- Stateless session management
- Easy integration with various providers
- Better security through token expiration
- Seamless user experience across pages

### API Design
**Decision**: RESTful API endpoints with proper error handling
**Rationale**:
- Consistent endpoint patterns
- Clear HTTP status codes for different scenarios
- Standardized error responses
- Easy to test and document

## Data Processing Approach

### Health Data Pipeline
**Decision**: Multi-stage processing (parsing → standardization → AI)
**Rationale**:
- Separation of concerns between data ingestion and AI processing
- Flexibility to support multiple data sources
- Ability to cache intermediate results
- Scalable architecture for different document types

### Document Parsing
**Decision**: Use docling for document parsing with Ollama for vision
**Rationale**:
- Open source solutions for document processing
- Local processing for privacy
- Support for various document formats (PDF, images)
- Integration with local LLM capabilities

## Security Considerations

### Privacy Focus
**Decision**: Local processing capabilities as primary mode
**Rationale**:
- Maximum user privacy protection
- No data sent to external servers
- User control over their health information
- Compliance with healthcare data regulations

### Data Encryption
**Decision**: Support for encryption keys in environment variables
**Rationale**:
- Sensitive data protection
- Environment-based configuration management
- Easy key rotation and management
- Secure handling of secrets

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy
**Decision**: Use SWR for data fetching and caching
**Rationale**:
- Automatic revalidation of cached data
- Stale-while-revalidate pattern
- Built-in loading and error states
- Better user experience with faster perceived performance

### Code Splitting
**Decision**: Leverage Next.js automatic code splitting
**Rationale**:
- Smaller bundle sizes
- Faster initial page loads
- Efficient resource utilization
- Better browser caching

## Deployment Architecture

### Containerization
**Decision**: Docker-based deployment with multiple profiles
**Rationale**:
- Consistent development and production environments
- Easy scaling and deployment
- GPU support for AI processing
- Isolated services for better maintainability

### Environment Management
**Decision**: Comprehensive environment variable handling
**Rationale**:
- Configuration per environment
- Security through secret management
- Flexibility for different deployment scenarios
- Clear separation between config and code

## User Experience Design

### Theme Management
**Decision**: Use next-themes for dark/light mode support
**Rationale**:
- Consistent theme across the application
- System preference detection
- Smooth transitions between themes
- Easy customization options

### Internationalization
**Decision**: Implement next-intl for i18n support
**Rationale**:
- Multi-language support from the start
- Server-side rendering for better SEO
- Type-safe translation keys
- Easy to add new languages

## Scalability Considerations

### Database Design
**Decision**: Normalize database schema with proper relationships
**Rationale**:
- Data integrity through foreign key constraints
- Efficient querying patterns
- Easy to extend with new entities
- Clear data ownership and permissions

### API Extensibility
**Decision**: Modular API route structure
**Rationale**:
- Easy to add new endpoints
- Clear organization of related functionality
- Reusable components across API routes
- Consistent error handling throughout

## Testing and Quality Assurance

### Type Safety
**Decision**: Comprehensive TypeScript usage
**Rationale**:
- Compile-time error detection
- Better code documentation
- Easier refactoring and maintenance
- Improved developer productivity

### Code Quality
**Decision**: ESLint and Prettier integration
**Rationale**:
- Consistent code style across the team
- Automated code formatting
- Early detection of potential issues
- Better collaboration experience

## Future Considerations

### Migration Path
**Decision**: Plan for TypeScript migration of Python components
**Rationale**:
- Consistent technology stack
- Easier maintenance and contributions
- Better type safety throughout
- Unified development experience

### Integration Points
**Decision**: Plugin-like architecture for LLM providers
**Rationale**:
- Support for multiple AI models
- Easy to add new providers
- Flexible configuration system
- Backward compatibility

## Summary

These design decisions reflect a balance between modern development practices, user privacy requirements, and scalability needs. The architecture emphasizes:

1. **Security and Privacy**: Local processing as the primary mode
2. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript implementation
3. **Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns and reusable components
4. **Performance**: Optimized data fetching and caching strategies
5. **Scalability**: Containerized deployment with Docker
6. **User Experience**: Responsive design with theme support and internationalization
7. **Maintainability**: Well-documented patterns and consistent code structure

These decisions provide a solid foundation for building health data management applications while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.
