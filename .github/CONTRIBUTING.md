# Contributing to OpenHealth

We firmly believe that AI can significantly improve personal health management. OpenHealth is built on this conviction, and we welcome contributions from everyone who shares this vision.

## üåü Our Core Principles

### 1. Help Others ü§ù
AI has the potential to improve personal health, but using it safely and effectively isn't always easy. Share knowledge, guide newcomers, and help others make the most of AI in healthcare. All community standards prioritize helping people improve their health.

### 2. Rationality, Intelligence, and Constructive Discussion üß†
The healthcare industry is full of marketing hype, pseudoscience, and misinformation. That's why we stay critical, think rationally, and demand real evidence for claims. If something works, why? If it doesn't, why not? Keep discussions logical, thoughtful, and constructive.

### 3. Your Health, Your Risk ‚ö†Ô∏è
AI can be wrong. But so can traditional medicine. Ultimately, you are responsible for your health decisions. Before making any important choices, verify information from multiple sources and think critically.
If you have any serious concerns, please talk to a doctor you trust.
