# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing a standalone iPhone application for personal health data management with AI-powered assistance. The app will allow users to import, store, and analyze their health documents locally on their device, with the ability to interact with AI assistants through external servers (Ollama for LLM, Docling for document processing). The application prioritizes privacy by keeping all personal health data local to the device, with optional iCloud backup functionality.

The app will be built using SwiftUI, target iOS 17+, and use SQLite for local data storage. It will support document scanning, file imports, and provide a chat interface for AI-powered health consultations using the user's personal health data as context.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a health-conscious individual, I want to securely store my personal health information locally on my iPhone, so that I can maintain complete privacy and control over my sensitive health data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN the user enters personal information THEN the system SHALL capture demographics, medical history, and physical measurements
3. WHEN the user enters blood test results THEN the system SHALL support the comprehensive blood test schema from the web application
4. WHEN the user saves health data THEN the system SHALL validate data format and store it with timestamps
5. WHEN the system is designed THEN it SHALL include placeholder structures for imaging reports, health checkups, and other future data types
6. WHEN the user views health data THEN the system SHALL display it in organized, readable formats with proper units and reference ranges

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user seeking health insights, I want to chat with an AI assistant that has access to my personal health data, so that I can get personalized health guidance and understand my health information better.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the chat interface THEN the system SHALL connect to a configured Ollama server for AI processing
2. WHEN establishing AI connection THEN the system SHALL use hostname and port configuration with placeholder for future authentication
3. WHEN the user sends a message THEN the system SHALL include relevant health data as context for the AI response
4. IF the health data context is too large THEN the system SHALL provide options for the user to select specific data to include
5. WHEN the user is offline THEN the system SHALL disable chat functionality and display appropriate messaging
6. WHEN chat history exists THEN the system SHALL store conversations locally and display them in chronological order
7. WHEN the AI responds THEN the system SHALL clearly distinguish between user messages and AI responses in the interface

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user concerned about data portability, I want to export all my health data in multiple formats, so that I can backup my information or transfer it to other systems if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects export functionality THEN the system SHALL provide options for JSON and PDF export formats
2. WHEN exporting to JSON THEN the system SHALL include all health data, documents, and metadata in a structured format
3. WHEN exporting to PDF THEN the system SHALL generate human-readable reports with proper formatting and organization
4. WHEN export is initiated THEN the system SHALL allow the user to select which data categories to include
5. WHEN export is complete THEN the system SHALL use iOS share functionality to save or send the exported data
6. WHEN exporting large datasets THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators and handle memory efficiently

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user who values privacy and control, I want granular control over iCloud backup settings and the ability to manage my data storage preferences, so that I can balance convenience with privacy concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses backup settings THEN the system SHALL provide options to enable/disable iCloud backup with clear privacy explanations
2. WHEN iCloud backup is enabled THEN the system SHALL request explicit user consent and explain what data will be backed up
