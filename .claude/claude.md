# Project-Specific Instructions

## Build Commands

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT run `xcodebuild` unless the user explicitly asks for it. Never run build commands automatically to verify code changes.

When the user wants to verify code:
- Only run `xcodebuild` if they specifically request a build
- Instead, rely on Xcode's automatic syntax checking
- Trust that the code changes are correct unless there's a specific error to investigate
